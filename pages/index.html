    <h2>About Us</h2> <br>
    <div class="aboutus">
        <p>
            At Sweet Delight Bakery, we believe that every moment deserves something sweet. 
            Our journey began with a simple passion for baking and a dream to create a place where people could 
            enjoy freshly made treats crafted with love and care. From the very beginning, we have focused on 
            using high-quality ingredients, traditional recipes, and a touch of creativity to bring you flavors 
            that feel both comforting and exciting. Every bread, cake, and pastry that comes out of our oven is 
            prepared fresh each day, ensuring the perfect balance of taste, texture, and aroma. <br>

            What truly sets Sweet Delight Bakery apart is our dedication to our customers and our community. 
            We are more than just a bakery—we are a warm and welcoming space where friends meet, families 
            celebrate, and sweet memories are made. Whether you are stopping by for your morning coffee and 
            croissant, ordering a custom cake for a special occasion, or simply treating yourself to something 
            delicious, our team is always here to make you feel at home. We take pride in our attention to detail, 
            friendly service, and commitment to excellence, because for us, baking is not just a job
            it’s an art and a joy we love to share with everyone who walks through our doors.

            <h2>We Love Macarons</h2>
            <h4>Discover Our Macarons Story!</h4><br><br>
            <p>In the early morning glow of the bakery, trays of macarons cooled on marble 
                counters, their pastel shells shining like tiny jewels. Soft pinks, sunny 
                yellows, and pale greens promised flavors both gentle and rich. Each macaron 
                cracked lightly at the first bite, giving way to a smooth, creamy center that 
                melted slowly, as if it wanted to be remembered. Customers lingered over them, 
                savoring the balance of sweetness and texture, knowing these small desserts 
                carried hours of careful folding, waiting, and patience. In that quiet moment, 
                the macarons became more than pastries—they were the bakery’s way of turning 
                ordinary mornings into something special.</p><br><br>
